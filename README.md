# [My online Curriculum Vitae](https://emma-guilbault.netlify.app/)

## What is it?

A `React` app, built with `Vite` and deployed with `Netlify` to showcase some of my front-end development skills. ✨

The design was made using `TailwindCSS` framework and the site is fully responsive! 📱💻

All functions and components are tested using `Vitest` and `Testing Library`. 🔒

In order to create clean and consistent code, I used the `Eslint` linter as well as `Prettier`, an opionionated code formatter.

All my pull requests are checked by running the linter, formatter, type checking and tests via Github Actions. 🛡️
